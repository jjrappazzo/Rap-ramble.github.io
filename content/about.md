My name is [**Jason Rappazzo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonrappazzo/). I am currently a senior at SUNY Geneseo majoring in Economics and Minoring in Data Analytics. In my final two years at [**Geneseo**](https://www.geneseo.edu/), I have developed a passion for Data Analytics. I am excited to build a blogging website that will also improve my coding skills at the same time.

I was struggling to come up with a name for this and I figured a lot of what I will be doing is rambling about my life, academic projects I am working on, and other things. I also like alliteration, so I went with Rap Ramble.

Feel free to reach out to me with any suggestions you may have! [**jjrappazzo@gmail.com**](https://www.gmail.com)

<p>Video games were a large part of my childhood especially playing on the Wii. One of my all time favorite games was Super Mario Galaxy. There was also Wii Sports, Tony Hawkâ€™s Downhill Jam, and the early Call of Duty Games. I have spent countless early mornings and many late nights playing video games. Though I have not played many video games in the past few years, they will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>Video games have a massive market. It was valued at <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=Report%20Overview,12.9%25%20from%202022%20to%202030."><strong>195 billion (USD)</strong></a> in 2021! General trends indicate strong positive trends going forward. This brought up a few questions to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which video game brought in the most amount of global sales?</li>
<li>Which year had the highest total sales across all video games?</li>
<li>Was there a dominant publisher that had the most sales?</li>
<li>Is there a particular console that generated the most sales?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I will be looking at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales"><strong>dataset</strong></a> to find the answers.</p>

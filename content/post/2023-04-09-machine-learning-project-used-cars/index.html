<p>This is my <a href="\Paper.pdf">research paper</a> on predicting the price of a used car using machine learning and deep learning techniques. I wrote this paper during the fall of my senior year at Geneseo in Data Analytics 300 - Advanced Data Analytics. The whole project was coded using Python and put together in Overleaf.</p>
